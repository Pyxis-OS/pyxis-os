# Technical debt and implementation tradeoffs

Record concrete limitations of implemented choices here: what we chose, its
cost, and when to reconsider it. This is a working record, not a roadmap or a
commitment to replace every simple implementation. Remove or update entries
when the underlying tradeoff changes.

## Contiguous RAM-file backing

RAM files currently own one kernel heap buffer. Growth reserves geometric spare
capacity when possible, falling back to the required size if that allocation
fails. Replacing a buffer temporarily holds both the old and new allocations
and copies the live contents. Large files therefore amplify peak memory usage
and copy cost; one allocation is also subject to TLSF's block-size limit.

Shrinking to a nonzero size retains capacity for reuse. Truncated bytes cannot
be observed after regrowth, but a small file may keep a much larger allocation.
Resize to zero or final object destruction returns the buffer to the heap;
the heap's existing pools remain mapped.

Reconsider this when larger files or memory pressure make those costs material.
Chunked backing and a policy for releasing excess capacity are possible changes,
not requirements for the current milestone. All-or-nothing writes are an
intentional [file contract](processes.md#implemented-file-calls), not debt.
