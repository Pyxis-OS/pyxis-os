# Technical debt and implementation tradeoffs

Record concrete limitations of implemented choices here: what we chose, its
cost, and when to reconsider it. This is a working record, not a roadmap or a
commitment to replace every simple implementation. Remove or update entries
when the underlying tradeoff changes.

## Contiguous RAM-file backing

RAM files currently own one kernel heap buffer. Growth reserves geometric spare
capacity when possible, falling back to the required size if that allocation
fails. Replacing a buffer temporarily holds both the old and new allocations
and copies the live contents. Large files therefore amplify peak memory usage
and copy cost; one allocation is also subject to TLSF's block-size limit.

Shrinking to a nonzero size retains capacity for reuse. Truncated bytes cannot
be observed after regrowth, but a small file may keep a much larger allocation.
Resize to zero or final object destruction returns the buffer to the heap;
the heap's existing pools remain mapped.

Reconsider this when larger files or memory pressure make those costs material.
Chunked backing and a policy for releasing excess capacity are possible changes,
not requirements for the current milestone. All-or-nothing writes are an
intentional [file contract](processes.md#implemented-file-calls), not debt.

## Retained userspace heap pools

Libc's TLSF allocator reuses freed blocks but retains every backing pool until
process exit. Pools are at least 64 KiB; there is no fixed pool-count registry.
A short-lived peak therefore leaves memory mapped for the rest of that process.
Shrinking `realloc` also keeps the original block capacity; growth may briefly
hold both blocks and copy contents to preserve 16-byte alignment.

Kernel process destruction reclaims all private backing, including live malloc
allocations. Reconsider empty-pool release and in-place aligned growth when
long-lived applications make retained capacity or copying material. The current
allocator and errno assume one thread per process; add synchronization and
thread-local errno when introducing userspace threads.

## Synchronous launch preparation

Each in-flight launch reserves a full 64 KiB metadata capture buffer plus a
small header from the kernel heap, even for short argument lists. BSP performs
child preparation with interrupts disabled, as for existing VM/heap services.
The executable file's operation ownership serializes reads, writes and resizes
through image validation/loading, avoiding another whole-image copy. Large
images therefore delay both BSP work and callers using that file.

Revisit staging size and preparation scheduling when larger applications or
concurrent launches make these costs material. A snapshot or immutable backing
could shorten file ownership, at a memory/complexity cost. No such mechanism or
asynchronous launch protocol is introduced now.

## Initial terminal editor

Libterm redraws the full visible line on each edit or cursor move and reads one
input byte per call. This keeps cursor/scroll behavior explicit and avoids
holding keystrokes needed by a future foreground child, at a syscall/rendering
cost. Revisit changed-span rendering or input buffering with an explicit handoff
when interactive workloads make that cost material.

Editing assumes exclusive output use. The single-CPU fallback shares Caelum's
TTY with scheduler/kernel logs, which can move the cursor during a read and
visibly disrupt its display. Input bytes and the returned line remain separate
from those writes. A real terminal ownership policy or separate log view is
needed before treating that fallback as a normal interactive environment.

The current editor accepts only one-cell ASCII and keeps the prompt/line/cursor
on screen. History, Unicode widths, larger-line viewports and Escape timing are
not implemented. These boundaries are recorded in [the terminal contract](terminal.md).
