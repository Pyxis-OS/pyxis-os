# Mouse input

The PS/2 mouse on the 8042's auxiliary port delivers relative motion, wheel
counts and button state through
[`mouse_read_event()`](../../include/kernel/mouse.h). One BSP kernel task
consumes them; the call is nonblocking and preserves interrupt state. This is
QEMU's default mouse. On the ThinkPad, the Synaptics touchpad in its firmware
relative mode reports as a standard PS/2 mouse without a wheel (device ID 0).
TrackPoint motion and buttons arrive through the same stream, and firmware
tap-to-click and tap-and-drag work; there is no scrolling in this mode.
Synaptics absolute mode and USB HID mice are not supported.

Events carry raw device counts without acceleration. Signs follow the display:
+dx is right, +dy is down and +wheel scrolls toward the user. The device's own
+Y is up, so the decoder negates it. `buttons` holds the left, right and middle
buttons after the packet. QEMU and some devices also send a packet with all
deltas zero, for example when a wheel step ends.

The presentation task drains these events into the kernel-owned physical
pointer and routes ordinary input to the shown surface. The
[system pointer interface](../interfaces/pointer.md) documents graphics sessions,
terminal control, geometry, cursor images, lock and source-loss handling.
[Mousetest](../userland/mousetest.md) provides an interactive consumer; the
[qualification report](../development/system-pointer-qualification.md) records
runtime checks and limits.

## Controller and setup

The [keyboard](keyboard.md) and mouse share one controller driver,
[`ps2.c`](../../arch/x86_64/ps2.c). Each received byte goes to the keyboard or
mouse queue according to the controller status register's auxiliary bit,
whichever of IRQ 1 or IRQ 12 announced it. Setup runs once on the BSP with
interrupts disabled. **A mouse failure leaves the mouse unavailable and never
fails keyboard setup or boot.** If keyboard setup fails, the mouse is not
attempted.

1. ACPI provides the IRQ 12 route alongside the keyboard's. An invalid IRQ 12
   override, or a route on another I/O APIC, beyond its inputs or sharing the
   keyboard's GSI, leaves the mouse unavailable. Without a route no auxiliary
   command is sent.
2. While the keyboard port is disabled, the controller must show a working
   second port: enabling and disabling it toggles the configuration bit, and
   the port test returns 0. A single-port controller would pass mouse commands
   to the keyboard, so this check precedes them.
3. After the keyboard selects scan set 2, and before it starts scanning, the
   auxiliary port is enabled and the mouse is reset, set to defaults, and
   probed for an IntelliMouse wheel (sample rates 200, 100, 80, then device
   ID 3). The sample rate returns to 100. Reset waits up to 4 s for its ACK and
   again for its self-test result, and other replies up to 500 ms. These are
   Linux libps2's bounds: Synaptics devices such as the ThinkPad's touchpad
   finish the reset before ACKing it. A responsive device costs nothing extra;
   a port with no device can add about 4 s to boot before the mouse is marked
   unavailable.
4. After keyboard scanning starts, the mouse enables reporting. Keyboard bytes
   that arrive while waiting for its ACK enter the keyboard queue. IRQ 12 is
   unmasked last.

A failure at any step logs the step, controller status and last reply, then
disables the auxiliary port and its interrupt.

## Packets

Packets are 3 bytes, or 4 with the wheel. The IRQ only queues bytes; the
consumer decodes them. A first byte without bit 3 set is skipped, which
realigns a shifted stream. A packet with an X or Y overflow bit keeps its
buttons and wheel but reports no motion. A full queue or a controller error
discards queued bytes and any partial packet, then the next read returns a
reset event; the consumer must release any buttons it considers held.

`unsynchronized_bytes`, `overflowed_packets` and `lost_inputs` in
[`mouse.c`](../../arch/x86_64/mouse.c) count these cases for debugger
inspection.

Resynchronization relies only on bit 3. A device that drops a byte mid-packet
can produce misaligned packets until a first-byte check fails; there is no
inter-byte timeout. During setup, a packet byte from firmware-enabled reporting
that equals an ACK or error reply can be mistaken for one; the result is at
worst an unavailable mouse for that boot.

## Manual inspection

From QEMU's monitor (Ctrl-a c on the serial terminal), `mouse_move 10 -5`
moves right and up, `mouse_move 0 0 1` is one wheel step away from the user,
and `mouse_button 1`, `2` and `4` press left, right and middle (`0` releases).
Under KVM, a hardware breakpoint on the instruction after `mouse_read_event()`
returns in `space_pointer_sync_input()`, conditioned on a true result, can print
each event. A hardware breakpoint set before boot can stop inside setup.
